Automatic colorisation of grayscale images using CycleGAN.

## Introduction
Image Colorization is the process of automatically colorizing an input grayscale image without manual interference by adding chrominance values  to grayscale images. It is an appealing area in the world of image processing. This project attempts to utilize CycleGANs to colorize grayscale images back to their colorful RGB form.

## CycleGAN Model
Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) are composed of two models:

1. Generator: Aims to generate new data similar to the expected one. The Generator could be related to a human art forger, which creates fake works of art.
2. Discriminator: It's goal is to recognize if an input data is ‘real’ — belongs to the original dataset — or if it is ‘fake’ — generated by a forger. In this scenario, a Discriminator is analogous to an art expert, who tries to detect artworks as truthful or fraud.
The CycleGAN consists of 2 generators and discriminators. One generator maps from domain A to B and the other one, from B to A. They compete with their corresponding adversarial discriminators.

To regularize the model, the authors introduce the constraint of cycle-consistency - if we transform from source distribution to target and then back again to source distribution, we should get samples from our source distribution.

## Data
The experiment was done on two datasets:
1. Grayscale images of Intel Landscape Image Dataset: 25k images.
2. Black-and-white frames extracted from old B&W movies: 24k images.

## Results
1. Intel Landscape Image Dataset.
